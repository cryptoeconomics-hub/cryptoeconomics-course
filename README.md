# Why is this stuff important?

Under every blockchain design there is some cryptoeconomics involved; and under every blockchain projects, there is too. Cryptoeconomics is the <b>secret ingredient</b> required in order for open, decentralised, secure, neutral, P2P network economies to work properly.</p>

We are trying to make fire by rubbing together two pieces of wood. This is pretty much how advanced the state of the art of cryptoeconomics is.</blockquote>

Lately, **token design** has become important, since with the advent of ICOs, many have now realised how simple the token design used to be or even how irrelevant the use of a token was.</p>

If the objective is to work out <b>robust designs</b> for decentralised economic networks and build a working society around blockchain based infrastructure, then cryptoeconomics is the first set of tools you will want to learn.</p>

			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Let's start with a formal definition of what cryptoeconomics is.</p>
		<blockquote>A formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in a decentralised digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterisation of these protocols. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VladZamfir" alt="Vlad Zamfir profile">Vlad Zamfir</a> [Ethereum Foundation]</b></blockquote>
		<p>The key part is about building an actual <b>decentralised digital economy</b>. You need a million of things to achieve that, but only a few fundamental components will be enough to start with.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Prove things that happened in the past, i.e <b>cryptography</b>.</li>
			<li>Incentivise people to participate, i.e <b>game theory</b>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><i>"Cryptoeconomics makes use of cryptography and game theory to design and characterise protocols"</i> means that cryptoeconomic protocols are usually <b>reverse games</b>: you know the results (what you want to happen in your newly created digital economy –this is also known as desirable outcome) and you look for the right rules of a game that will adequately incentivise people to participate. Whatever the rules of the game, participants will –amongst other things– base their actions on non-arguable events that happened in the past and for that we use <b>cryptographic proofs</b>.</p>
		<p>For designers, the difficulty of cryptoeconomics lies in two things: the design of the rules of the game and the understanding of the underlying technical components that will make the design a functional reality as intended. In the next sections, you will find directions to make your way through the field of cryptoeconomics.</p>
