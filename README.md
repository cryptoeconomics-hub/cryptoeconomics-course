# Why is this stuff important?

Under every blockchain design there is some cryptoeconomics involved; and under every blockchain projects, there is too. Cryptoeconomics is the **secret ingredient** required in order for open, decentralised, secure, neutral, P2P network economies to work properly.

>We are trying to make fire by rubbing together two pieces of wood. This is pretty much how advanced the state of the art of cryptoeconomics is.

Lately, **token design** has become important, since with the advent of ICOs, many have now realised how simple the token design used to be or even how irrelevant the use of a token was.

If the objective is to work out **robust designs** for decentralised economic networks and build a working society around blockchain based infrastructure, then cryptoeconomics is the first set of tools you will want to learn.

This is a formal definition of cryptoeconomics.
>A formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in a decentralised digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterisation of these protocols. **[Vlad Zamfir](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir) [Ethereum Foundation]**

The key part is about building an actual **decentralised digital economy** You need a million of things to achieve that, but only a few fundamental components will be enough to start with.
* Prove things that happened in the past, i.e **cryptography**.
+ Incentivise people to participate, i.e **game theory**.

*Cryptoeconomics makes use of cryptography and game theory to design and characterise protocols"* means that cryptoeconomic protocols are usually **reverse games**: you know the results (what you want to happen in your newly created digital economy –this is also known as desirable outcome) and you look for the right rules of a game that will adequately incentivise people to participate. Whatever the rules of the game, participants will –amongst other things– base their actions on non-arguable events that happened in the past and for that we use **cryptographic proofs**.

For designers, the difficulty of cryptoeconomics lies in two things: the design of the rules of the game and the understanding of the underlying technical components that will make the design a functional reality as intended. In the next sections, you will find directions to make your way through the field of cryptoeconomics.
